"""s03 / transports — one server, two transports: stdio and Streamable HTTP.

Lesson mapping: Section 3, Lessons 9-12.
What it does:
  1. ONE server implementation (tools: echo, add) with a JSON-RPC 2.0 handle()
  2. stdio: this file re-invoked as a subprocess speaking NDJSON on stdin/stdout
  3. HTTP: ThreadingHTTPServer on an ephemeral localhost port, POST JSON-RPC
  4. anatomy_inspector + concurrent round_trip_trace (3 threaded calls, id check)
Logging goes to stderr only — stdout belongs to the protocol on stdio.
